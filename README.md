<h1>IoT-Manual VinylFlow</h1>
  <p>This is a manual to connect my NODEMCU to the spotify API. My goal is to get information about a specific song or artist.<br>
    I want to communicate with the node via Telegram.
  </p>

<h2>Spotify API</h2>
<p>
The first step is to create an API token from Spotify. You can do this by logging in at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard. If you don’t have an account yet, create one. It’s free. <br>
